# CounselingScheduler
This application is specifically tailored for the Counseling Center as a way to automate the scheduling process of clinicians to appointment slots. It comes with two levels of permissions: an administrator level and clinician level.

The typical workflow of the scheduling application follows the following process:
1. An administrator will revise and update the list of clinicians which are available for a particular semester. 
2. The administrator will then enter in the new semester settings establishing start/end dates, holidays and number of hours assigned to each clinician for IA and EC appointments by default. 
3. The clinicians will each submit their preferences to the system which includes time they need off and their preferred time slots to work. 
4. The administrator can then go through and modify and clinician preferences or hours assigned to a particular clinician until they are satisfied. 
5. The administrator can then generate a schedule which creates an IA and EC appointment schedule for the semester. They can freely modify the generated schedule and will be notified if they break any schedule constraints. When they are content with the final schedule they can choose to print or save the schedule to a file.
